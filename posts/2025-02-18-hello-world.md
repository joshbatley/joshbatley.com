#  Hello World

{meta}

Today marks the beginning of my blogging journey. This blog will serve as a platform to document my adventures in building personal projects, brainstorming new ideas, critiquing existing ones, and sharing anything else that comes to mind—mostly related to coding.

I envision future projects that will allow me to pursue my passions. Through this blog, I aim to track my progress and hopefully cultivate a community of like-minded individuals. For now, it remains a personal coding diary.

This blog is crafted by me, for me. If you find it intriguing, feel free to connect with me on social media. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoy writing it.

Let's kick things off by outlining my current projects:

## Game Engine & Co

I am developing a game engine using Rust. This project is my gateway to mastering native and low-level programming, allowing me to delve into game development and graphics—areas I've always been eager to explore but rarely have the opportunity to engage with in my daily work.

## The Experiment

This project involves a multi-language monorepo that simulates live payment data. It's designed to help me learn how to build services from scratch that handle production-like data and throughput. It also provides a flexible environment to add or modify services, essentially creating a sandbox for developing a suite of tools and APIs. This is my playground for experimenting with new tools, languages, and packages.

## Edgmont UI

Edgmont UI is an ongoing project where I'm developing a React-based UI library. Currently, it supports web applications and can be extended to native desktop via Electron and other such tools. Plans are in place to expand into mobile applications using React Native.

## Project Learning

This project is my personal lab for learning about algorithms, data structures, and creating small programs like SQLite clones and tools similar to GraphQL and RPC. It's a space where I can build and understand the fundamentals of various systems—essentially deconstructing the black box to learn how things work from the inside out.
